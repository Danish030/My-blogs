        The Palestinian territories have long been marred by a multitude of atrocities and injustices inflicted upon its population. From the systematic displacement of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem and the West Bank to the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, the Israeli occupation has perpetuated a cycle of oppression and dispossession. Palestinians endure daily humiliations at checkpoints, arbitrary arrests, and detention without trial. The besieged Gaza Strip suffers from crippling blockade, denying its inhabitants access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, and adequate healthcare. The disproportionate use of force by Israeli military forces against unarmed Palestinian civilians, including children, has resulted in countless casualties and widespread trauma. Despite international condemnation, impunity prevails for Israeli authorities, exacerbating the suffering and perpetuating a cycle of violence and injustice for Palestinians.
